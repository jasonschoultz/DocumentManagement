What You're Envisioning
You want to build a web application that:

Connects to SharePoint/OneDrive storage
OCRs documents (extracting text from images/PDFs)
Analyzes the content to automatically categorize documents
Presents an indexed, searchable interface to users

Technical Feasibility
This is definitely possible! Here's a high-level architecture:
Backend Components:

SharePoint/OneDrive API integration - Microsoft Graph API provides access to files
OCR Service - Options include Tesseract (open source), Azure Computer Vision, Google Cloud Vision, or AWS Textract
Content Analysis - Use NLP or AI (like Claude's API) to categorize documents based on OCR'd text
Database - Store metadata, categories, and extracted text
API Layer - Serve data to the frontend

Frontend:

React or similar framework for the web interface
Search and filtering capabilities
Category browsing
Document preview

Key Considerations

Authentication - You'll need Microsoft OAuth to access SharePoint/OneDrive
Processing Volume - OCR can be time-intensive for large document collections
Privacy/Security - Important if handling sensitive documents
Cost - Cloud OCR services charge per page/image

Would you like me to create a prototype or proof-of-concept for any specific part? For example, I could build:

A demo frontend showing how the categorized index might look
Sample code for connecting to Microsoft Graph API
An example of how to process and categorize OCR results
